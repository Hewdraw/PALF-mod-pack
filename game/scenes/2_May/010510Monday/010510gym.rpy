alder @happy2 "Good morning, everyone! Good to see you all back in classes again. We missed you!"

pause 1.0

alder @talking2mouth "Didn't we, Bruno?"

bruno norm3 @norm4 "I am glad to see my students again. You all look fit and ready to train."

hilda uniform @happy "Hell yeah! Let's break some heads!"

bruno @norm4 "That is the spirit. First, though, Alder and I must deliver a lecture."

alder @happy2 "Right you are, Bruno. Today, we're going to be learning about item manipulation."
alder @talkingmouth "Can anyone tell me what the rules are for items in most regions?"

misty uniform @talkingmouth "I can. You're allowed to remove any item the opponent is holding, as long as it's not in a special category. Moves like Knock Off or Trick can be used to do that."

alder @happy2 "Makes sense that the Cerulean scion would know this."

misty @sadbrow talkingmouth "...Right."

alder @talkingmouth "You're doing well, Misty. Carry on."

misty @talkingmouth "U-um... right. Well, the special categories are Mega Stones and Z-Crystals. There are also some other items that power up specific species."
misty @closedbrow talkingmouth "You're not allowed to touch those in battles. If a Pokémon loses possession of them during the fight, due to dropping it, or something like that, the battle is paused for the Pokémon to regain possession of the stone."

alder @happy2 "Exactly correct!"
alder @talkingmouth "...However, we do the exact {i}opposite{/i} in Kobukan."

flannery uniform @surprised "Huh? But in the Lavaridge Gym, we..."

alder @talkingmouth "Yes, in Kobukan, items can be removed at your leisure. If you can take a Mega Stone from a Pokémon, you can even prevent them from Mega Evolving!"

bruno norm @norm2 "This is dishonorable."

alder @happy2 "But {i}effective!{/i}"

redmind uniform @thinking "I'm not sure how effective it'd be, actually... that one Lopunny didn't need a Mega Stone, after all..."

if HasEvent("Professor Oak", "ForeveralsFiguredOut"):
    redmind @thinking "And it wouldn't work on me, at all. The Foreverals seem to generate an endless stream of Mega Stone-like objects for my Pokémon."

    redmind @happy "Shame they only last until the end of the battle. If they lasted longer, I could sell them!"

elif HasEvent("Professor Oak", "ForeveralsALittleBit"):
    redmind @thinking "Besides, if I'm understanding these gems right, the Foreverals seem to generate an endless stream of Mega Stone-like objects for my Pokémon."

    redmind @happy "Shame they only last until the end of the battle. If they lasted longer, I could sell them!"

alder @talkingmouth "Anyway, the basic thing we're trying to impart here is that the rules of many other regions don't necessarily apply here."

alder @talkingmouth "You may have also noticed that in this region, Pokémon are allowed to be sent out immediately after another faints."

hilbert uniform @sadbrow talkingmouth "'Allowed to'? You mean they {i}have{/i} to be, to take incoming hits."

alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "You could choose to see it that way. You could also choose to see it as an opportunity to switch in a Pokémon with Storm Drain, or Lightning Rod, or Intimidate, in the middle of your turn."

hilbert @angry "If I wanted to do {i}that{/i}, I'd just use a Pokémon with U-Turn, first."

alder surprised @sad2 "Alright, Hilbert. Tell me when your Honedge learns U-Turn."

hilbert @sadbrow talkingmouth "As long as you tell {i}me{/i} when my Cubchoo gets Intimidate."

alder -surprisedbrow -frownmouth -surprised @closedbrow happymouth "Ah, it's good to be back in class, isn't it, Bruno?"

bruno happy @happy2 "Very much so."

alder @talkingmouth "Anyway, to wrap up this lecture on items, remember that you get back any item you started with at the end of each battle."
alder @happy2 "Except berries, of course."

pause 0.5

alder @talkingmouth "Now, why don't we start off with some battles?"
alder @closedbrow talkingmouth "Our unit this week will be triple battles." 

hilda @angrybrow talking2mouth "Hell yeah!"

alder @happy2 "Nice enthusiasm, Hilda! As you all must know, the range of your moves matters more in this format than in any other!"

jasmine @sadeyebrows talkingmouth "Hello, [first_name]."

red @talkingmouth "Hey, Jasmine. I don't think I've seen you in this class very often?"

jasmine @closedbrow talking2mouth "No, I often get an exception for this class... and I can barely do the physical training anyway."

red @happy "Hey, all a trainer really needs to train is their voice."

jasmine @surprised "No, no, not at all! A good trainer should be able to run around with their Pokémon. Follow them in battle, and move around the field to get a better vantage point and view of the battlefield!"
jasmine @closedeyes angryeyebrows talking2mouth "And, of course, a trainer should be fast enough on their feet to avoid any stray moves... the best trainers are the trainers who stay closest to their Pokémon in battle."
jasmine @happy "Only when you're standing side-by-side with your Pokémon can you see how they should react to your opponent's moves."

pause 1.0

jasmine @closedbrow talking2mouth sweat "Of course... I say all that, but have difficulty really {i}practicing{/i} it. I certainly can't run around the field with them."

red @sadeyebrows talkingmouth "I'm sure they appreciate the thought."

jasmine @closedbrow talkingmouth "Well, my Pokémon are very slow. So, at the least, I can stand by their side in battle."

red @surprised "Wait, you do that? Isn't that dangerous?"

jasmine @happy "Absolutely. But putting oneself in danger to bolster one's friends is a very noble calling, I think."

red @happy "You really never stop impressing me."

pause 1.0

jasmine lightblush @talkingmouth "I... was impressed by your speech on Friday."

red @surprised "Huh?"

jasmine @sad2eyes talkingmouth "I actually thought... well, I thought the extent of your power was greater than it was. Grusha convinced me otherwise, though."

jasmine @talkingmouth "Not much story to share, I'm afraid. I had access to a Metal Coat, and thought my partner Onix might look rather good in it."

        jasmine @sweat happy "I offered it to him, since he likes Ground-types, but... ah... he said it was, quote, 'filthy and far too rugged.'"

        jasmine @talkingmouth closedbrow "Well, he was only an elementary-schooler at the time. People change. One thing that {i}hasn't{/i} changed is his devotion to Pokémon contests."
        jasmine @talkingmouth "He got me into them, actually."

    ">Stay silent":
        jasmine @talkingmouth "I'm sure that would help my Steelix truly shine in contests. A well-timed Mega Evolution can turn the judges in your favor like nothing else."

red @talkingmouth "Oh, you do contests, too? With that cracked team, I figured you would be on the trainer course."

jasmine @talkingmouth "I'm exploring my options. The only thing that doesn't seem to be on the table right now is, well, Student Council member."

red @sadbrow talking2mouth "...I'm sorry about that."

jasmine @talkingmouth "You've nothing to apologize for. This was just a terrible misunderstanding."
jasmine @sad2eyes talking2mouth "I'm concerned for Cheren, though. What he did was ill-advised, but it seems he's more interested in punishing himself than actually making things right..."
